# ToolBox_SEG
This project file presents an in-depth and efficient deep learning training framework designed for image segmentation and related image processing tasks, blending comprehensiveness and automation. By integrating end-to-end the process from data preprocessing and enhancement, to model training, optimization, and evaluation, as well as checkpoint management and result analysis, the framework puts special emphasis on ease of operation and process efficiency. Combined with the implementation of advanced libraries such as PyTorch, sklearn, etc., it not only supports highly flexible data processing and model training strategies, such as by introducing K-fold cross validation and `albumentations` data enhancement libraries to improve model generalization and evaluation accuracy, but also realizes semiautomatic network model training by automatically saving the training data to CSV files. function, which greatly reduces the burden of manual data management. This feature, combined with the modular design and flexible checkpoint mechanism, not only ensures the reproducibility and reliability of the training process, but also improves the training efficiency. Overall, by deeply integrating best practices, the framework provides an easily scalable, efficient, high-performance, and semi-automated training and evaluation platform for image processing tasks.
